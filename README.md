# Pizza Scheduling Simulation

## Operating Systems
### Description 
A Java-based simulation of a pizzeria's operations that demonstrates operating system scheduling concepts through the management of resources like ovens, chefs, and delivery drivers. The project implements multi-threading to simulate concurrent operations in a pizza restaurant, showcasing how different resources need to be scheduled and synchronized to fulfill customer orders efficiently.

Key features:
- Multi-threaded simulation of pizzeria operations
- Resource scheduling for ovens, chefs, and delivery drivers
- Implementation of scheduling algorithms for resource allocation
- Concurrent order processing and fulfillment
- Thread synchronization and resource management

### Project Structure
The simulation is organized into several key components:
- Resource management (ovens, chefs, drivers)
- Order processing system
- Scheduling algorithms
- Thread synchronization mechanisms
- Performance monitoring

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding operating system scheduling concepts
- Implementing multi-threading in Java
- Managing resource allocation and synchronization
- Applying scheduling algorithms in a real-world scenario
- Handling concurrent operations and race conditions
